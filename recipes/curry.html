                <p>Reduce skillet heat to simmer. Add the noodles and let simmer 
                    until flavors are absorbed, about 5 minutes. Divide chicken

        <h2 class="subtitle">Ingredients</h2>

                <ul>
                    <li>2 tbsp. coconut oil</li>
                    <li>16 oz. skinless, boneless chicken breast halves,
                        cut into small cubes
                    </li>
                    <li>14 oz. cream of coconut</li>
                    <li>11oz red Thai curry sauce</li>
                    <li>16 oz. dried rice stick vermicelli noodles</li>
                </ul>


        <h2 class="subtitle">Steps</h2>

                <ol>
                    <li>Heat oil in large skillet on high heat. Add chicken cubes;
                        cook until browned (about 2 minutes per side). Reduce heat to
                        medium-high and add coconut cream and curry sauce. Cook until
                        chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices 
                        run clear (about 5 minutes). An instant-read thermometer
                        inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F.
                    </li>
                    <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a 
                        rolling boil; stir in vermicelli pasta and return to a boil. 
                        Cook pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta 
                        is tender yet firm to the bite, 4 to 5 minutes. Drain.</li>
                    <li>Reduce skillet heat to simmer. Add the noodles and let simmer 
                        until flavors are absorbed, about 5 minutes. Divide chicken 
                        and noodles among individual serving bowls.</li>
                </ol>
