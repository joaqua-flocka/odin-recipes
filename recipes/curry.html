        <p>Reduce skillet heat to simmer. Add the noodles and let simmer 
            until flavors are absorbed, about 5 minutes. Divide chicken 
            and noodles among individual serving bowls.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tbsp. coconut oil</li>
            <li>16 oz. skinless, boneless chicken breast halves,
                cut into small cubes
            </li>
            <li>14 oz. cream of coconut</li>
            <li>11oz red Thai curry sauce</li>
            <li>16 oz. dried rice stick vermicelli noodles</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oil in large skillet on high heat. Add chicken cubes;
                cook until browned (about 2 minutes per side). Reduce heat to
                medium-high and add coconut cream and curry sauce. Cook until
                chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices 
                run clear (about 5 minutes). An instant-read thermometer
                inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F.
            </li>
            <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a 
                rolling boil; stir in vermicelli pasta and return to a boil. 
                Cook pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta 
                is tender yet firm to the bite, 4 to 5 minutes. Drain.</li>
            <li>Reduce skillet heat to simmer. Add the noodles and let simmer 
                until flavors are absorbed, about 5 minutes. Divide chicken 
                and noodles among individual serving bowls.</li>
        </ol>
