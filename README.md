# odin-recipes

I am undertaking this project as a part of The Odin Project Foundations course. It is going to be a simple recipe website. Upon finishing the project I will return to this file and discuss what I have learned.

Note: All recipes borrowed from AllRecipes.com. I'm an
awful chef so I have no clue if these are good.
